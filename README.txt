To Run:

1.)Simply download v3.0.1+ of Andriod Studio

2.)There is a run button in the upper right hand coner of the program to run

3.)A dialog box should pop up asking what device you want to use
	If your phone is plugged in and developer options are enabled, you can use that, otherwise we installed the virtual device (emulator) for the Nexus 5X, which is an 		option in the "Create New Virtual Device" button menu. Word of warning with the emulator, it is very RAM and processor intensive, so give it a minute when loading.

4.)Once you emulation or phone is running, you can choose it from the run menu popup dialog and press ok.

If any errors come up while trying to run the program, feel free to email or message me, Adam Smestad, contacts below:
